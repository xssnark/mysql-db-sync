A simple, limited shell script for synchronizing MySQL databases between servers.
This script uses my.cnf defaults files for managing the migration of data between the source
and destination databases. An example defaults file mmay contain:

	[client]
	host=your_db_hostname
	database=my_database
	user=my_username
	password="my_secret_passord"

To use, create two of these files, one for the source database
(perhaps named "source_db_config") and one for the destination (perhaps named "dest_db_config").
Call this script with these config files as arguments, for example:

	$0 -v -n -s source_db_config -d dest_db_config

Note this command would operate in dry-run mode and not actually perform any operations.

Required Arguments:
-s or --source-config my.cnf-file
-d or --destination-config my.cnf-file
	This is to specify a source and destination my.cnf file. This must be used to pass username,
	password, host, and database settings for accessing the servers.
Optional Arguments
-a
--after-sql
        This is to specify a sql scripts file to execute in destination server after sync finished.
-o
--dump-database
	This specifies the specific database name to dump from the source host. (mysqldump will NOT use
	database specification in the config files, at least not that I've been able to determine. It
	must have database names passed on the command line.)
	If this is omitted, the script will attempt to determine the database for the source database
	by connecting to the source and issuing a select DATABASE() and then capturing the output.
	This argument only affects the SOURCE database, the destination will be the database configured
	in the destination defaults file.
-v
--verbose
	Spew a lot of messages about what's happening.
-l
--verbose-mysql
	Run MySQL commands in verbose mode. (Mnemonic: "loud"; Independent of -v argument)
-n
--dry-run
	Don't perform the cleaning, dump, or import operations.
